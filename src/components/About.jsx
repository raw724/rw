          Me in three words? Driven, energetic, and passionate. With my experience as a school prefect throughout sixth form and my work as a Senior Sailing instructor alongside being Manager on Duty at Pizza Express,
          I have experience in many situations. Being in two managerial roles proves my ability to work hard, motivate and support a team and represent a brand in every moment. Trusted in organizing and running sailing events and
          school charity/parent events shows I can adapt to any scenario, work alongside a team with confidence and keep customers engaged effectively.
